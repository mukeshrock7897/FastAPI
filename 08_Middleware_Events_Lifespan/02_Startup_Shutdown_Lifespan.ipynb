    "* Initialize **database connections / pools**\n",
    "* Warm up caches or load configs from secret stores\n",

    "## ⚖️ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep startup fast → don’t block on heavy jobs\n",
    "* Fail early if critical deps (DB, cache, secrets) are unavailable\n",
    "* Log structured errors on shutdown for debugging\n",
    "* Keep lifespan code minimal → delegate to service modules\n",

    "Your API boots with all **dependencies ready** and shuts down with all **resources released** → stable, predictable, and testable in every environment.\n",
