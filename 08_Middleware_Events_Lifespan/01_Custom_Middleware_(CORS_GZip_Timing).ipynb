    "# 🧩 Custom Middleware (CORS · GZip · Timing)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Add cross-cutting behavior (security, performance, observability) around every request/response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What Middleware Does\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runs **before** and **after** your route handler\n",
    "* Ideal for **headers**, **compression**, **timing**, **request IDs**, **rate limits**, **auth pre-checks**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Controls which **origins** can call your API from browsers\n",
    "* Configure **allowed origins/methods/headers**, and **credentials** if needed\n",
    "* Keep the **allowlist tight**; don’t use `*` with credentials\n",
    "* Document CORS policy for frontend teams\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗜️ GZip (Compression)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compresses text responses (JSON/HTML/CSV) to save bandwidth\n",
    "* Helps on slow/mobile networks; minimal CPU overhead for text\n",
    "* Don’t compress already-compressed media (JPEG/PNG/MP4)\n",
    "* Consider **Brotli** if supported by your infra/CDN\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ Timing (Latency & Diagnostics)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measure **request duration** end-to-end\n",
    "* Emit **metrics** (histograms) and add headers (e.g., `X-Response-Time`)\n",
    "* Correlate with **request IDs** for tracing across services\n",
    "* Surface slow endpoints and regressions early\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 Request / Correlation IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate or forward a **request ID** (e.g., `X-Request-ID`)\n",
    "* Attach to logs, traces, error responses\n",
    "* Critical for debugging distributed systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Ordering & Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "* Typical order: **CORS → Request ID → Timing → Compression → Routes**\n",
    "* Keep middleware **small & deterministic**\n",
    "* Put **auth/parse** logic in dependencies; use middleware for **global** concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure timing/logging runs even on exceptions\n",
    "* Sanitize error payloads; avoid leaking internals\n",
    "* Emit structured logs (level, route, status, duration, request\\_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Security Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* CORS is **not** auth; still validate tokens/permissions\n",
    "* Beware header spoofing; trust only from **known proxies/CDNs**\n",
    "* Rate limit sensitive routes at middleware/gateway level\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expose **metrics**: request count, latency, error rates, payload sizes\n",
    "* Add **trace context** headers (W3C Traceparent) for distributed tracing\n",
    "* Sample wisely to control telemetry cost\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A **safer, faster, and debuggable** API:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CORS** gates browser access, **GZip** saves bandwidth,\n",
    "* **Timing + Request IDs** make issues visible and traceable.\n"
