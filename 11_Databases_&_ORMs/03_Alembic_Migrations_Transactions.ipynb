    "# 🧭 Alembic Migrations & Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Evolve your database schema **safely** over time with versioned migrations and **transactional integrity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 What Alembic Gives You\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Versioned history** of schema changes (upgrade/downgrade)\n",
    "* **Autogenerate** diffs from SQLAlchemy models (then review)\n",
    "* **Offline/online** modes for CI/CD and prod rollouts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Typical Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update models (or raw SQL).\n",
    "2. **Autogenerate** a revision → review & edit.\n",
    "3. **Upgrade** local, run tests.\n",
    "4. Promote to staging → prod via CI/CD.\n",
    "5. Track head(s) and stamp environments as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ Autogenerate vs Manual\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Autogenerate**: great for adds/renames/simple alters → always review.\n",
    "* **Manual**: required for data migrations, complex constraints, custom SQL.\n",
    "* Keep migration scripts **idempotent** and **explicit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔒 Transactions & Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prefer **transactional DDL** (Postgres supports most; MySQL varies).\n",
    "* Group related DDL + data changes in a **single transaction** when possible.\n",
    "* Fallback: break into **safe steps** if engine lacks transactional DDL.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Data Migrations (DML)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate **schema then data** (or vice versa) to keep steps small.\n",
    "* Use **batched updates** for large tables; avoid full-table locks.\n",
    "* Backfill with **nullable + default** before enforcing **NOT NULL**.\n",
    "* Write **reversible** data steps when practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🕒 Zero/Low-Downtime Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expand → Migrate data → Contract** (a.k.a. parallel fields, dual writes).\n",
    "* Add new column **nullable**, write both old/new, backfill, then **switch** reads.\n",
    "* Avoid blocking ops (e.g., column type changes) during peak traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing Migrations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run migrations on a **fresh DB** and on a **copy with existing data**.\n",
    "* Verify **upgrade → downgrade → upgrade** round trips in CI.\n",
    "* Assert constraints, indexes, and non-null invariants post-migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability & Ops\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log revision id, head(s), and duration per migration.\n",
    "* Alert on **long-running DDL**, locks, and replication lag.\n",
    "* Keep a **runbook** (rollback steps, safety checks, owner contacts).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧷 Rollbacks & Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement **downgrade** where safe; otherwise, plan **forward fixes**.\n",
    "* Take **backups/snapshots** before risky changes.\n",
    "* For irreversible changes, include **compensating migrations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Multi-Env Hygiene\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate **alembic.ini** configs per env or parameterize via env vars.\n",
    "* Store **DB URL in secrets**, not in repo.\n",
    "* Keep **one head** per branch; resolve merge conflicts with a **merge revision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A disciplined migration practice: **reviewed revisions**, **transactional safety**, and **downtime-aware** rollouts—so your schema evolves without breaking your app or your users.\n"
