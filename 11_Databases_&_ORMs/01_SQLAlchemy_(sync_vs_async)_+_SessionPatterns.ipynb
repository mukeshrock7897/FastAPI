    "# üóÑÔ∏è Databases with SQLAlchemy (Sync vs Async)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** ‚Üí Connect FastAPI to relational databases using **SQLAlchemy**, with clear patterns for sync & async sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß≠ Why SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mature, widely adopted ORM/DB toolkit\n",
    "* Provides both **Core (SQL builder)** and **ORM (models + sessions)**\n",
    "* Works with **Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, etc.**\n",
    "* Integrates cleanly with FastAPI via **dependency injection**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö° Sync vs Async\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sync Engine** (`create_engine`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Simple, works everywhere (SQLite, Postgres, etc.)\n",
    "  * Blocking ‚Üí fine for light DB loads\n",
    "* **Async Engine** (`create_async_engine`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Non-blocking, leverages `async/await`\n",
    "  * Better for high-concurrency APIs\n",
    "  * Requires async drivers (`asyncpg`, `aiosqlite`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÑ Session Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Session = unit of work** (wraps queries + transactions)\n",
    "* Scoped per request:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Open session at request start\n",
    "  * Commit/rollback at end\n",
    "  * Close/dispose connection safely\n",
    "* Injected via **FastAPI dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üóÇÔ∏è Typical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "* `models.py` ‚Üí ORM models (classes mapped to tables)\n",
    "* `database.py` ‚Üí engine + session factory\n",
    "* `crud.py` ‚Üí data-access layer (encapsulates SQLAlchemy queries)\n",
    "* `main.py` ‚Üí injects sessions into routes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öñÔ∏è Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep DB access in **service/CRUD layer**, not routes\n",
    "* Always handle **commit/rollback** to avoid leaks\n",
    "* Use **connection pooling** for performance\n",
    "* Prefer **async sessions** in I/O-heavy apps (lots of concurrent DB + HTTP calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Testing DB\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **SQLite in-memory** for unit tests\n",
    "* Wrap tests in **transactions + rollbacks** for isolation\n",
    "* Provide **override dependency** for test sessions in FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîê Security & Ops\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store DB URL in **env/secret manager**\n",
    "* Use **parameterized queries** (ORM handles this)\n",
    "* Monitor **connection pool usage** and DB errors\n",
    "* Apply migrations (Alembic) ‚Üí keep schema in sync\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A solid, reusable database layer using SQLAlchemy‚Äîwhether **sync or async**‚Äîthat integrates with FastAPI via **session-per-request**, ensuring safety, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
