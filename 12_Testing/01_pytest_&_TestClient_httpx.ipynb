    "# 🧪 Testing with pytest, TestClient & httpx\n",

    "> **Intent** → Validate routes, dependencies, and contracts in fast, isolated tests for both **sync** and **async** paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What to Test\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Happy paths**: expected 2xx responses and payload shapes\n",
    "* **Error paths**: 4xx/5xx with meaningful error bodies\n",
    "* **Auth & permissions**: 401/403, scope checks, role gating\n",
    "* **Contracts**: response models, required fields, enums, defaults\n",
    "* **Side effects**: DB writes, cache changes, emitted events\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 Tooling Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pytest**: simple, fast test runner with fixtures & parametrization\n",
    "* **TestClient** (sync): wraps ASGI app for quick route tests\n",
    "* **httpx** (async): **AsyncClient** for testing async routes and lifespans\n",
    "* **pytest-asyncio**: run async tests with event loops\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Choosing the Client\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **TestClient** for **purely sync** tests or quick smoke tests\n",
    "* Use **httpx.AsyncClient** for **async** routes, WebSockets, and lifespan hooks\n",
    "* Keep a **single shared app factory** so tests create fresh app instances\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Fixtures & Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **App fixture**: create app per test module/session with deterministic settings\n",
    "* **Client fixture**: yields TestClient or AsyncClient tied to the app’s lifespan\n",
    "* **DB fixture**: in-memory/ephemeral DB; wrap each test in **transaction + rollback**\n",
    "* **Data factory**: generate entities (users, items) with sensible defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Dependency Overrides\n",
    "\n",
    "* Override **auth** to inject test users/roles\n",
    "* Override **DB sessions** to point to the test DB\n",
    "* Override **external clients** (HTTP/cache/queue) with fakes or stubs\n",
    "* Keep overrides **scoped** (per-test or per-module) for clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Assertions that Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Status codes** (200/201/204/4xx)\n",
    "* **Response schema** (required fields, types, enums)\n",
    "* **Headers** (auth, caching, CORS, rate-limit)\n",
    "* **Idempotency** (repeating POST with same key)\n",
    "* **Side effects** (row counts, updated fields, emitted messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 Mocks & Stubs\n",
    "\n",
    "* **httpx mocking** for outbound calls (return canned responses, timeouts)\n",
    "* Clock/UUID/random → inject via DI and **freeze** in tests\n",
    "* Avoid global monkeypatching; prefer **fixture-based** fakes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Coverage & Parametrization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parametrize inputs (valid/invalid, boundary cases)\n",
    "* Snapshot **error shapes** to guard against accidental changes\n",
    "* Track coverage, but prioritize **critical paths & contracts** over 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Performance & Flakiness\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep tests **small and deterministic**\n",
    "* Avoid real sleeps; use **time control** or fast fakes\n",
    "* Limit network/IO in unit tests; push integration tests to separate suite\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 CI Pipeline Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run **unit tests** on every PR (fast)\n",
    "* Run **integration/e2e** nightly or on main branch\n",
    "* Fail fast on schema/contract changes; publish artifacts (coverage, reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A reliable testing setup that validates **behavior, contracts, and side effects** using pytest with **TestClient/httpx**, keeping your API stable as it evolves.\n"
