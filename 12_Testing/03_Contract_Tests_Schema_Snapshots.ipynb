    "> **Intent** → Prove your API **hasn’t broken clients** by locking down **response shapes** and **OpenAPI schema** over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What Are Contract Tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tests that verify the **public contract** (status codes, fields, types, enums)\n",
    "* Focus on **responses and errors**, not internal implementation\n",
    "* Fail when a change would **break consumers** (web, mobile, partners)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 Schema Snapshots (OpenAPI)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Export current **OpenAPI JSON** and store as a **snapshot**\n",
    "* On CI, compare new schema → snapshot\n",
    "* If diff is unintended, tests fail → prevents accidental changes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What to Lock Down\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Routes** and **methods** (no surprise renames/removals)\n",
    "* **Response models** (required fields, types, nullability)\n",
    "* **Error shapes** (`detail`, codes, field errors)\n",
    "* **Enums & examples** (don’t silently change meanings)\n",
    "* **Security schemes** (auth flows, scopes)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Golden Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save **known-good JSON** for key endpoints (happy + error paths)\n",
    "* Compare future responses against goldens (stable order/format)\n",
    "* Normalize time/IDs to avoid flaky diffs (e.g., mask or freeze)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Versioning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **breaking changes**, bump API version (e.g., `/v2`)\n",
    "* Keep **v1** contract unchanged until fully deprecated\n",
    "* Communicate deprecations via headers and docs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Managing Expected Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "* When intentional change: update **snapshot** and **changelog**\n",
    "* Add **compat adapters** during migrations (old → new shape)\n",
    "* Provide **feature flags** or **preview headers** for early adopters\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 CI Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run contract tests on every PR\n",
    "* Produce a **human-readable diff** (routes added/removed, fields changed)\n",
    "* Block merges on unexpected schema diffs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Safety & Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don’t snapshot **sensitive data**; use sanitized fixtures\n",
    "* Ensure error bodies don’t leak internals (stack traces, SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Your API stays **predictable and backward compatible**. Contract tests and schema snapshots **catch breaking changes early**, protecting client apps and enabling safe, iterative evolution.\n"
