    "# 🔧 Dependency Overrides, Fixtures & Factories\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Swap real dependencies with **fakes**, **fixtures**, or **factories** so tests run fast, isolated, and repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Dependency Overrides\n",
    "\n",
    "* FastAPI allows replacing dependencies in `app.dependency_overrides`.\n",
    "* Use for **auth** (inject test users/roles) or **DB sessions** (use in-memory SQLite).\n",
    "* Override **external clients** (httpx, Redis, queue) with stubs.\n",
    "* Scope overrides per test/module to avoid leaking state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 pytest Fixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "* **App fixture** → creates a fresh FastAPI app instance.\n",
    "* **Client fixture** → provides TestClient/AsyncClient with lifespan context.\n",
    "* **DB fixture** → spins up test DB, rolls back per test.\n",
    "* Fixtures = **reusable building blocks** for setup/teardown.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏭 Factories\n",
    "\n",
    "* Factories generate **valid test data** quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Users with default username/password\n",
    "  * Items/orders with random but valid fields\n",
    "* Helps avoid boilerplate and keeps tests readable.\n",
    "* Can extend to **invalid/fuzzy data** for negative tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep overrides **minimal and explicit** → don’t hide logic in tests.\n",
    "* Make fixtures **stateless** (reset DB, clear cache each run).\n",
    "* Document which fixtures exist and what they guarantee.\n",
    "* Use **naming consistency** (`app`, `client`, `db_session`, `user_factory`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run tests without **real DBs or external APIs**.\n",
    "* Control **auth & data** precisely per test.\n",
    "* Prevents **flaky tests** caused by shared/global state.\n",
    "* Encourages **fast feedback** in CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "With dependency overrides, pytest fixtures, and data factories, your test suite becomes **clean, reliable, and expressive**—validating API behavior without relying on fragile external systems.\n",
