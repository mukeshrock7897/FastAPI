    "## 🎯 What to Inject\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Configuration** (settings, feature flags)\n",
    "* **Database/session** (scoped per request)\n",
    "* **Auth context** (current user, scopes/roles)\n",
    "* **HTTP/Cache clients** (httpx/redis), **clock/uuid** for testability\n",

    "## 🧭 How to Think About It\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handlers = orchestration** only; no heavy logic\n",
    "* **Dependencies = providers** of ready-to-use objects\n",
    "* **Explicit contracts** → easier to read, swap, and test\n",

    "\n",
    "* Keep dependencies **small and specific** (single responsibility)\n",

    "Routes stay **clean and declarative**; behavior is **composable, testable, and replaceable**—supporting reliable, maintainable APIs at scale.\n"
