    "# 🧭 Routing & Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Design clear, stable endpoints and accept input safely from URL, query, and body—plus headers, cookies, forms, and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Paths, Queries, Bodies\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Path params** → Identify a specific resource (stable, required).\n",
    "* **Query params** → Filters/sorting/pagination (optional, combinable).\n",
    "* **Request body** → Complex inputs (create/update payloads).\n",
    "* **Consistency** → Nouns for resources, verbs via HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏷️ Resource Design\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collections**: `/items` (list/create)\n",
    "* **Members**: `/items/{id}` (read/update/delete)\n",
    "* **Subresources**: `/users/{id}/orders` (scoped lists)\n",
    "* **Actions**: prefer state changes to stay RESTful; use verbs sparingly for non-CRUD operations (e.g., `/invoices/{id}/send`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Validation & Types (Pydantic v2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strong types** for path/query/body → fewer runtime errors.\n",
    "* **Field constraints** for length, ranges, formats.\n",
    "* **Examples & defaults** → better docs and DX.\n",
    "* **Enums** for finite choices (status, role, sort order).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Headers, Cookies, Forms, Files\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Headers** → auth tokens, idempotency keys, client hints.\n",
    "* **Cookies** → session flows for browser clients.\n",
    "* **Forms** → HTML form submissions and login flows.\n",
    "* **Files** → single/multi uploads; store externally; return references.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Idempotency & Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GET/HEAD** → safe, no side effects.\n",
    "* **PUT/DELETE** → idempotent by design.\n",
    "* **POST** → use **Idempotency-Key** for retriable operations.\n",
    "* **Pagination** → page/limit or cursor-based; always bound limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Errors & Contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clear status codes**: 200/201/204, 400/401/403/404, 409, 422, 429, 500.\n",
    "* **Structured error shape**: message, code, field errors.\n",
    "* **Documentation first**: keep responses in OpenAPI with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filtering**: `?status=active&owner=me`\n",
    "* **Sorting**: `?sort=-created_at` (minus = desc)\n",
    "* **Sparse fields**: `?fields=id,name`\n",
    "* **Embedding/expansion**: `?include=profile,roles`\n",
    "* **Versioning**: path (`/v1/...`) or header (prefer header for longevity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔒 Security Touchpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Auth**: bearer tokens in **Authorization** header.\n",
    "* **Scopes**: tie routes to permissions.\n",
    "* **CORS**: allow only trusted origins; narrow methods/headers.\n",
    "* **Rate limiting**: per route or key; communicate limits via headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prefer **cursor pagination** for large datasets.\n",
    "* Validate early; reject oversized bodies.\n",
    "* Stream large downloads/uploads; avoid loading everything in memory.\n",
    "* Cache read-heavy endpoints (ETag/If-None-Match).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏁 Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A **clean, predictable** routing layer with **typed inputs**, **clear contracts**, and **safe handling** of headers, cookies, forms, and files.\n"
