    "\n",
    "* Carry **metadata** like auth tokens, API keys, request IDs\n",
    "* Useful for **idempotency keys**, locale, versioning\n",
    "* Must be validated (don’t trust blindly)\n",

    "## 🍪 Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manage **browser sessions**\n",

    "* Used in **HTML form submissions** (login, contact forms)\n",

    "## 📂 Files\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **uploads**: images, PDFs, CSVs, etc.\n",

    "* Return **references/URLs**, not raw blobs\n",

    "## 🎯 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validate size & type of uploads\n",
    "* Restrict cookie usage to trusted domains\n",
    "* Require headers for auth, correlation, and safety\n",
    "* Keep forms & files minimal → avoid bloated requests\n",
