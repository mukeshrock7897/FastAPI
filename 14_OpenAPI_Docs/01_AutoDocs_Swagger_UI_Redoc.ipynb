    "# 📚 Auto Docs: OpenAPI, Swagger UI & ReDoc\n",

    "## 🧭 What You Get Out-of-the-Box\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OpenAPI spec** generated from routes, models, responses\n",
    "* **Swagger UI** (interactive playground)\n",
    "* **ReDoc** (clean, readable reference)\n",
    "* Live **try-it-out** with auth headers and example payloads\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Build Great Docs by Design\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Models**: separate **Create/Update/Out** → clear shapes\n",
    "* **Response models** on every route → stable contracts\n",
    "* **Examples & descriptions** on fields and endpoints\n",

    "## 🔐 Security in Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define **security schemes** (Bearer JWT, API keys)\n",
    "* Mark **required scopes** per route → visible to clients\n",
    "* Provide **example tokens** (non-sensitive) for try-it-out\n",

    "## 🧩 Discoverability & UX\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **summary** (one-liners) + **description** (details)\n",
    "* Add **operationId** for client SDK generation\n",
    "* Keep **tag names** short and consistent\n",
    "* Curate **error responses** with example bodies (422, 401, 403, 404)\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧾 Accuracy & Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Treat the spec as a **contract**\n",
    "* Snapshot **OpenAPI JSON** in tests (contract testing)\n",
    "* Document **deprecations** and **version changes** explicitly\n",
    "* Avoid breaking changes; introduce **/v2** when needed\n",

    "\n",
    "* QA can **copy/paste** example requests\n",
    "* Generate **typed clients** (TS/Swift/Kotlin) from the spec\n",
    "* Contract tests compare responses against **documented schemas**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Maintaining Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep examples **realistic and minimal**\n",
    "* Update **descriptions** when behavior changes\n",
    "* Ensure **status codes** and **headers** match runtime behavior\n",
    "* Review docs in PRs like code (treat them as user-facing UI)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Your API becomes **self-documenting and trustworthy**: developers can explore with **Swagger UI**, read clean references in **ReDoc**, and rely on an **accurate OpenAPI contract** for integration and automation.\n"
