    "> **Intent** → Offload **small, fire-and-forget** work *after* sending the HTTP response (e.g., send email, write audit log).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧭 When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tiny tasks (ms–seconds) that don’t need durability\n",
    "* Post-response side effects: emails, webhooks, analytics, cache warms\n",
    "* Non-critical jobs where occasional failure is acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptually)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Route returns response → framework runs your **registered function** in the background\n",
    "* Runs **in the same process** as your app worker\n",
    "* Shares the app’s memory; no external broker required\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Good Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep tasks **idempotent** (safe to run twice)\n",
    "* Pass **small, serializable data** (IDs, not big payloads)\n",
    "* Add **timeouts** and guardrails inside the task\n",
    "* Log start/end + errors for visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Know the Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No durability**: tasks vanish if the worker restarts/crashes\n",
    "* **No scheduling/retries** by default\n",
    "* **Competes** with request handling; long tasks block the worker\n",
    "* Not suitable for CPU-heavy or long-running jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Safety & Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validate inputs again inside the task (don’t trust route context)\n",
    "* Use **request IDs / correlation IDs** in logs\n",
    "* Avoid touching request/response objects (they’re gone post-return)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Emit metrics: **task count**, **success/fail**, **duration**\n",
    "* Add structured logs with **task name** and **arguments** (scrub secrets)\n",
    "* Alert on repeated failures\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 When to Upgrade to a Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "* Need **retries**, **scheduling**, or **durability** → use Celery/RQ/Arq\n",
    "* Tasks are **slow/CPU-bound** or many in parallel\n",
    "* Need **rate limiting**, **distributed workers**, **backoff strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏁 Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "You get **instant, lightweight** background execution for small post-response work—great for prototypes and simple side effects. For reliability and scale, move to a **real task queue**.\n"
