    "# 📦 Task Queues (Celery · RQ · Arq) + Retries\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Run **reliable, asynchronous** work outside HTTP requests with **retries, scheduling, and scaling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 When to Use a Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tasks need **durability** (survive restarts)\n",
    "* Require **retries/backoff**, **scheduling**, or **rate limiting**\n",
    "* Work is **slow**, **CPU-bound**, or **many-in-parallel**\n",
    "* You want **separate worker processes** to protect API latency\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Producer**: your API enqueues a job\n",
    "* **Broker**: Redis/RabbitMQ holds jobs\n",
    "* **Workers**: separate processes pull & execute\n",
    "* **Result backend** (optional): store results/metadata\n",
    "* **Monitoring**: dashboards for queues, retries, failures\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Choosing a Library\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Celery** (mature, feature-rich)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pros: robust retries, scheduling (beat), routing, ETAs, chords\n",
    "  * Cons: more config; RabbitMQ/Redis; heavier footprint\n",
    "* **RQ** (Redis Queue, simple)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pros: minimal, easy; Redis only; good for small/medium workloads\n",
    "  * Cons: fewer primitives; extensions for scheduling/retries\n",
    "* **Arq** (asyncio + Redis)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pros: native **async** tasks; simple; fast for I/O-bound\n",
    "  * Cons: smaller ecosystem; fewer advanced patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Retries & Backoff\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exponential backoff** with jitter to avoid thundering herds\n",
    "* **Max attempts** and **circuit breakers** for persistent failures\n",
    "* **Retry only transient errors** (network, rate limit); fail fast on invalid payloads\n",
    "* **Poison message** handling → move to **dead-letter queue** for inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Idempotency & Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make tasks **idempotent**: safe on re-run (use **Idempotency-Key** or task keys)\n",
    "* Guard against **double effects** (unique DB constraints, UPSERTs)\n",
    "* Keep payloads **small** (IDs, not blobs) and fetch data in worker\n",
    "* Validate inputs again in workers (don’t trust producer context)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🕒 Scheduling & Delays\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ETA/Countdown**: run later (post-commit hooks after DB write)\n",
    "* **Periodic tasks**: cron-like schedulers (Celery Beat / external cron)\n",
    "* Separate **human schedules** (crons) from **system retries** (backoff)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Concurrency & Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pick **concurrency model**: threads/processes/async (Arq)\n",
    "* **CPU-bound** → processes; **I/O-bound** → threads/async\n",
    "* Limit **queue depth** per worker; use **prefetch** wisely\n",
    "* Use **routing/priority queues** for critical vs bulk tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability & Ops\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track **enqueue → start → finish** durations; **success/fail rates**\n",
    "* Log **task name**, **args** (scrub secrets), **request\\_id** correlation\n",
    "* Expose health endpoints: broker connectivity, backlog length\n",
    "* Alerts on **stuck queues**, **high retry rates**, **DLQ growth**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Security & Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don’t put **secrets** or **PII** in task payloads; use IDs\n",
    "* Encrypt at-rest if broker/backends store sensitive metadata\n",
    "* Enforce **authn/z** at data boundaries (workers re-fetch with service creds)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Failure Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* On final failure → **DLQ** + notification (Slack/Email/Pager)\n",
    "* Provide **replay tooling** (manual requeue with safe limits)\n",
    "* Record **root-cause** tags (dependency outage, validation error)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚢 Deployment Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Separate** API and worker containers; scale independently\n",
    "* Ensure **graceful shutdown** (finish in-flight, stop taking new)\n",
    "* Pin versions; keep **task code** in shared package to avoid drift\n",
    "* Blue/green workers for task code changes with DB migrations\n",

    "A **resilient, scalable** background processing layer with **retries, scheduling, and observability**—keeping your API fast while heavy work happens **off the request path**.\n"
