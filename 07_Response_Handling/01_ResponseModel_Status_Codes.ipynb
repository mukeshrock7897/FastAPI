    "* Prevents leaking sensitive fields (passwords, tokens)\n",
    "* Standardizes API responses → easier for frontend/mobile teams\n",

    "* **200 OK** → Successful GET, PUT, DELETE (with response body)\n",
    "* **201 Created** → New resource created (return representation or ID)\n",
    "* **204 No Content** → Successful DELETE/PUT without body\n",
    "* **400 Bad Request** → Invalid input (validation error, wrong params)\n",
    "* **401 Unauthorized** → Missing/invalid credentials\n",
    "* **403 Forbidden** → Valid user, but insufficient permissions\n",
    "* **404 Not Found** → Resource does not exist\n",
    "* **409 Conflict** → Resource already exists / state conflict\n",
    "* **422 Unprocessable Entity** → Validation failed (Pydantic errors)\n",
    "* **500 Internal Server Error** → Unexpected error (should be rare)\n",

    "## ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always pair **response\\_model** with the route → stable output\n",
    "* Use **status\\_code parameter** in decorators → explicit contracts\n",
    "* Keep **errors structured**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  { \"detail\": \"Employee not found\" }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Return **meaningful messages**, not just codes\n",

    "## 🏁 Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients get **predictable, validated responses** with the **right status codes**, making your API **trustworthy, self-documenting, and easy to consume**.\n",
