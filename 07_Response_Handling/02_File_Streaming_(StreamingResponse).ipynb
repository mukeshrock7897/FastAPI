    "\n",
    "* Use when returning **static files** (PDFs, images, CSVs, docs).\n",
    "* Common for **download endpoints** (`/reports/{id}/download`).\n",
    "* Supports setting **filename, MIME type, headers** (e.g., `Content-Disposition`).\n",
    "* Secure: ensure only **authorized users** can download.\n",

    "* **FileResponse** → static files, on-demand exports.\n",
    "* **StreamingResponse** → dynamic or big content (don’t buffer in memory).\n",
    "* Combine with **generators** or **async iterators** for scalable streaming.\n",

    "## 🔐 Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validate **paths** → never expose arbitrary file access.\n",
    "* Apply **auth/permissions** before sending.\n",
    "* Set correct **MIME type** (avoid accidental script execution in browsers).\n",
    "* Add **rate limits** for large downloads/streams.\n",

    "## ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **ETags** / `If-None-Match` for caching heavy file endpoints.\n",
    "* Compress (GZip/Brotli) for text streams.\n",
    "* Prefer **temporary signed URLs** for large/bulk downloads.\n",
    "* Document file/stream endpoints in OpenAPI with correct media type.\n",

    "## 🏁 Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Your API delivers **files and large data safely and efficiently**, without blocking memory, while remaining **secure, scalable, and client-friendly**.\n",
