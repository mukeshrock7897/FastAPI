    "# 🔄 CI/CD (GitHub Actions) + Smoke & Healthchecks\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Automate build, test, and deploy pipelines with **fast feedback** and **post-deploy verification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Pipeline Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lint & Type Check** → flake8, mypy, black (fail fast).\n",
    "2. **Unit & Contract Tests** → pytest + coverage, schema snapshots.\n",
    "3. **Build Image** → Docker multi-stage, tag with git SHA + semver.\n",
    "4. **Security Scan** → deps (pip-audit), image scan (Trivy/Grype).\n",
    "5. **Deploy** → staging → prod, gated by approvals.\n",
    "6. **Post-Deploy Checks** → smoke + health endpoints before traffic shift.\n",

    "## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Workflows**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`.\n",
    "* **Triggers**: PRs (tests), merges to `main` (deploy).\n",
    "* **Secrets**: stored in GitHub → injected at runtime.\n",
    "* **Artifacts**: cache wheels, test reports, Docker layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Smoke Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimal checks after deploy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * GET `/health` → returns 200\n",
    "  * GET `/docs` → OpenAPI loads\n",
    "  * Auth route works with known test token\n",
    "* Run **before shifting traffic** or marking deploy successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🫀 Healthchecks in Prod\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Readiness** → is service ready to take traffic? (DB/queue connected)\n",
    "* **Liveness** → is process alive? (event loop, thread health)\n",
    "* Expose `/health` (app deps) vs `/live` (just process).\n",
    "* Tie into orchestrator (K8s probes, ECS health checks).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Security in CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pin action versions (`@v3` not `@main`).\n",
    "* Least-privilege deploy keys (write-only to target env).\n",
    "* Sign images/artifacts; verify before deploy.\n",
    "* Scan for leaked secrets in PRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability in Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "* Record build times, test durations, deploy success/fail.\n",
    "* Alert on **slow builds**, **flaky tests**, or **failed smoke checks**.\n",
    "* Keep dashboards: coverage %, image sizes, deploy frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Rollbacks & Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blue/green or canary → rollback fast if smoke fails.\n",
    "* Auto-scale down bad release while keeping old alive.\n",
    "* Store last known good image tag for quick redeploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "CI/CD ensures every commit is **tested, secured, built, deployed, and verified** automatically—so your FastAPI app ships **faster, safer, and more reliably**.\n",
