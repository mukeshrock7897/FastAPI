    "# 🔐 Env & Secrets (.env, Vault, KMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Keep configuration **outside code** and protect **secrets** across dev/stage/prod with auditable, least-privilege access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What Belongs Where\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environment variables**: non-secret config (feature flags, log level), secret *references* (URIs/keys).\n",
    "* **Secret stores**: DB passwords, API keys, JWT signing keys, OAuth client secrets.\n",
    "* **.env (local only)**: developer convenience; never commit; mirror prod names.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Options Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* **.env files** → fast local dev; easy to rotate locally; **not for prod**.\n",
    "* **Cloud Secret Managers** (AWS Secrets Manager/SSM, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) → managed storage, IAM policies, audit logs, versioning.\n",
    "* **Vault** (HashiCorp) → dynamic secrets, lease/renew/revoke, rich policies.\n",
    "* **KMS (AWS/GCP/Azure)** → encrypt/decrypt payloads or envelope-encrypt files; combine with a store.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Access & IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "* App gets **short-lived credentials** (workload identity, service accounts).\n",
    "* Scope permissions to **read only** specific secret paths.\n",
    "* Rotate keys regularly; prefer **automatic rotation** if supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Load & Refresh Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Startup fetch**: load secrets at boot (simple, fewer calls).\n",
    "* **On-demand**: cache in memory; refresh on TTL/rotation event.\n",
    "* Expose **health checks** that fail if critical secrets can’t be fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Packaging & Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don’t bake secrets into images.\n",
    "* Inject via **env** at deploy time (Kubernetes Secrets, ECS Task env, etc.).\n",
    "* Use **sealed/encrypted** manifests if you must keep values in Git (SOPS + KMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing & Local Dev\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide a sample **`.env.example`** (names only, no real values).\n",
    "* Use **test secrets** with reduced scope; never reuse prod keys.\n",
    "* In CI, pull from a **CI-scoped secret store** (separate project/account).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Crypto & Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate **signing keys** (JWT) from **encryption keys**.\n",
    "* Prefer **asymmetric** keys for token signing (rotate without downtime).\n",
    "* Store KMS key IDs in env; perform crypto via **KMS APIs** when feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Incident Readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track **who accessed what** (audit trails).\n",
    "* Roll secrets quickly: rotate, invalidate old, restart pods gracefully.\n",
    "* Maintain **runbooks** for leaked key response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log **key usage metrics** (count, latency, errors)—never values.\n",
    "* Alert on **access denials**, unusual spikes, or repeated decrypt failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Secrets stay **out of code and images**, managed by **proper IAM** with **rotation and auditability**, while your app reads config via **env** in a safe, portable way.\n"
