    "# üîó FastAPI ‚Üî Streamlit Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** ‚Üí Combine **FastAPI backends** with **Streamlit frontends** for interactive apps powered by APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß≠ Why Integrate\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FastAPI** ‚Üí serves data, ML models, auth, business logic.\n",
    "* **Streamlit** ‚Üí provides quick, interactive UI for exploration.\n",
    "* Together: build **dashboards, AI tools, internal apps** with clean separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Streamlit calls FastAPI via **httpx/requests** ‚Üí fetch JSON, display.\n",
    "* FastAPI provides **REST/GraphQL endpoints** for Streamlit to consume.\n",
    "* Auth handled at FastAPI layer (JWT/API key); Streamlit just forwards headers.\n",
    "* Streamlit‚Äôs `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource` ‚Üí reduce API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ML demos**: FastAPI serves models; Streamlit shows predictions.\n",
    "* **Data apps**: FastAPI queries DBs; Streamlit plots interactive charts.\n",
    "* **Admin tools**: FastAPI handles mutations; Streamlit manages UI.\n",
    "* **LLM agents**: FastAPI orchestrates chains; Streamlit acts as UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîê Security\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don‚Äôt expose secrets in Streamlit; call FastAPI with tokens from **secrets.toml**.\n",
    "* Enforce **RBAC/scopes** on API routes.\n",
    "* Use HTTPS between Streamlit ‚Üî FastAPI.\n",
    "* Throttle/validate requests; Streamlit UIs can be abused if public.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add **request IDs** from Streamlit ‚Üí FastAPI for trace continuity.\n",
    "* Monitor API latency to ensure UI feels responsive.\n",
    "* Log **frontend errors** separately (Streamlit logs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öñÔ∏è Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep **UI logic** in Streamlit, **business logic** in FastAPI.\n",
    "* Version the API so Streamlit updates don‚Äôt break.\n",
    "* Document endpoints for non-Streamlit consumers too.\n",
    "* Deploy separately but co-located (same VPC/region) for low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit becomes a **lightweight frontend** over a **FastAPI backend**, enabling rapid development of **interactive, secure, and scalable apps**.\n",
