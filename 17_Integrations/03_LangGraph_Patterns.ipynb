    "> **Intent** → Orchestrate **multi-step LLM workflows** as explicit **state machines/graphs** for reliability, debuggability, and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 When to Use LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need **branching** (tool success/fail), **loops** (retry/refine), or **parallel** steps.\n",
    "* You want **deterministic control flow** (not just “agent magic”).\n",
    "* You must **resume**, **inspect**, and **replay** runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Core Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes**: atomic steps (LLM call, tool call, policy check, router).\n",
    "* **Edges**: transitions based on **state** or **conditions**.\n",
    "* **State**: shared context (inputs, memory, artifacts, errors).\n",
    "* **Checkpoints**: persistence for **resume/inspect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Common Graph Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plan → Act → Observe → Decide** loop with a **max step** guard.\n",
    "* **Router node** → choose subgraph (search vs DB vs summarizer).\n",
    "* **Guardrail node** → validate/clip outputs before proceeding.\n",
    "* **Fallback path** → on failure/timeouts, try simpler model/tool.\n",
    "* **Parallel tools** → fan-out queries; **join** + aggregate results.\n",
    "* **Human-in-the-loop** → pause at approval nodes; continue on signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔒 Safety & Policy Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pre-step: **input sanitization** (PII filter, allowlist).\n",
    "* Mid-step: **tool policy** (which tools allowed per tenant/role).\n",
    "* Post-step: **output validator** (schema match, toxicity filter).\n",
    "* **Escape hatches**: abort on repeated violations; log evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability & Control\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log **node timings**, **retries**, **chosen edges**.\n",
    "* Attach **trace\\_id** across nodes and downstream services.\n",
    "* Persist **state snapshots** at checkpoints for offline debug.\n",
    "* Expose **run metadata** (graph version, tool versions, costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎛️ Configuration-as-Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Externalize **graph topology**, **thresholds**, **models**, **temperature**.\n",
    "* Version configurations; **pin** in each run for reproducibility.\n",
    "* Feature flag **new edges/nodes** for canary testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deterministic stubs** for tools + LLMs (fixed outputs).\n",
    "* **Path coverage**: test each branch (success, failure, timeout).\n",
    "* **Contract tests** on **graph inputs/outputs** per node.\n",
    "* Snapshot **state** after critical nodes to catch regressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚖️ Performance & Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimize **token churn**: compact state, summarize memory.\n",
    "* Reuse results with **caching** (retrieval, tool outputs).\n",
    "* Batch external calls where possible; set **budgets** per run.\n",
    "* Short-circuit early on **low-confidence** or **policy fail**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Multi-Tenant Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Namespace **state & checkpoints** per tenant.\n",
    "* Per-tenant **tool access** and **rate limits**.\n",
    "* Record **usage** (tokens, time) per tenant for billing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Deployment Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Synchronous**: request → run graph → response for short flows.\n",
    "* **Asynchronous**: enqueue run → callbacks/webhooks on completion.\n",
    "* **Streaming**: stream node outputs/tokens over WebSocket/SSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph turns complex LLM workflows into **explicit, testable graphs** with **safety gates, observability, and versioned configs**—ready for production-grade automation.\n",
