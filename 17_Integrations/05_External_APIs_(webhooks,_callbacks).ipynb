    "# 🧪 LangSmith (Eval) & Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Measure and improve LLM quality with **traces, datasets, evaluations, and CI gates** wired into your FastAPI flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What LangSmith Gives You\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tracing**: step-by-step runs (prompts, tool calls, latencies, errors).\n",
    "* **Datasets**: curated inputs + expected outputs (goldens).\n",
    "* **Evaluations**: automatic metrics (accuracy, BLEU/ROUGE), LLM-as-judge, custom scorers.\n",
    "* **Comparisons**: run A/B on prompt/model/config changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Where to Hook in FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Request boundary**: log inputs, request\\_id, tenant, version.\n",
    "* **Agent/tool layer**: capture tool calls, retries, errors, timings.\n",
    "* **Output stage**: record final answer, tokens, cost, confidence.\n",
    "* **Background jobs**: trace long-running evals asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Datasets & Goldens\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store real user-like prompts with **expected outputs** or scoring rules.\n",
    "* Keep **edge cases** (long context, multilingual, safety triggers).\n",
    "* Version datasets; tag by **domain** and **difficulty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📏 Scoring & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exact/semantic match** (string vs embedding similarity).\n",
    "* **Task-specific**: extraction accuracy, field-level F1, hallucination rate.\n",
    "* **LLM-as-judge**: rubric-based scoring with **bias controls** (multiple judges, consensus).\n",
    "* **Cost/latency**: tokens, wall time per step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Regression & A/B\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run **candidate vs baseline** across the same dataset.\n",
    "* Flag **quality regressions** (thresholds per metric).\n",
    "* Record **diff artifacts** (where candidate failed/won).\n",
    "* Promote only if **guardrails + metrics** pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Guardrails with Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-exec**: input policy checks (PII, prompt injection).\n",
    "* **Mid-exec**: tool allowlists, depth/step limits, rate caps.\n",
    "* **Post-exec**: output validators (schema, toxicity, safety tags).\n",
    "* On violation: **abort or downgrade** model; log evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 CI Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "* PR pipeline: run **smoke eval** (small dataset) → block on regressions.\n",
    "* Nightly: **full suite** across domains; publish dashboards.\n",
    "* Store **run IDs** and link to PR/commit for traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧬 Versioning & Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pin **model**, **prompt**, **tools**, **temperature**, **system msg** per run.\n",
    "* Log **config hashes**; attach to each trace.\n",
    "* Keep **prompt diffs** human-readable for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Privacy & Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redact** sensitive inputs/outputs before logging.\n",
    "* Use **tenant-aware** storage; restrict dataset access.\n",
    "* Align with **compliance** (retention, deletion, audit trails).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 What to Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pass rate by dataset, latency distributions, token costs.\n",
    "* Top failing cases & common error tags (format, hallucination, safety).\n",
    "* Trend lines across releases; burn-down of known failure modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Your LLM features become **measurable and reliable**: end-to-end traces, reproducible evals, CI gates, and safety hooks that **prevent regressions** and guide **prompt/model improvements**.\n"
