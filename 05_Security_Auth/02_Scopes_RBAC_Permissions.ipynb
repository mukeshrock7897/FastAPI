    "## 🎯 Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represent **fine-grained capabilities** (e.g., `read:users`, `write:orders`)\n",
    "* Declared in JWT claims → validated at request time\n",
    "* Routes define **required scopes** → enforce automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Users belong to **roles** (admin, editor, viewer)\n",
    "* Roles map to **sets of scopes**\n",
    "* Easier to manage at scale than assigning scopes one by one\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scopes = technical abilities**\n",
    "* **Permissions = business rules** (who *should* have them)\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scope → `delete:project`\n",
    "  * Permission → only project owner or admin role can use it\n",

    "## ⚖️ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grant **least privilege** → minimal scopes per role\n",
    "* Keep **role-to-scope mapping** centralized (policy module/service)\n",
    "* Audit regularly: remove unused roles/scopes\n",
    "* Support **hierarchies** (admin includes editor, etc.) if org needs it\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing Access\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unit tests with **fake users** carrying different scopes/roles\n",
    "* Contract tests to verify **403s are enforced** consistently\n",
    "* Simulate escalation attempts to catch leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏁 Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Your API enforces **least privilege**, ensures **clear separation of roles vs capabilities**, and keeps authorization **predictable, auditable, and testable**.\n",
