    "# 🚀 Uvicorn Workers, Timeouts & Keepalive\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Tune Uvicorn/Gunicorn settings so your FastAPI app stays **fast, reliable, and resilient under load**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Worker Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uvicorn (standalone)** → good for dev & small prod apps\n",
    "* **Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers** → production-grade, multi-process, manages restarts\n",
    "* **Worker types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `UvicornWorker` → sync/async mix, most common\n",
    "  * `UvicornH11Worker` → pure HTTP/1.1\n",
    "  * `UvicornUWSGIWorker` → rare, legacy use\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔢 How Many Workers?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rule of thumb: `workers = 2 × CPU cores + 1`\n",
    "* Use more for **CPU-bound** apps, fewer if **DB/network bound**\n",
    "* Balance with **DB connection limits** (don’t oversubscribe)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ Timeouts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`--timeout`** → max seconds a worker can take per request (default often too high)\n",
    "* **Shorter is safer**: fail fast, retry upstream\n",
    "* **Separate long tasks**: use background workers/queues instead of huge timeouts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Keepalive\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`--keep-alive`** → controls idle HTTP connection reuse\n",
    "* Helps for **HTTP/1.1 clients** making multiple requests\n",
    "* Set to \\~5–10s for most APIs; tune higher for chatty clients\n",
    "* Too high = more open sockets; too low = more reconnect overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Handling Crashes & Hangs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gunicorn master monitors workers → restarts unhealthy ones\n",
    "* Use **`--graceful-timeout`** for cleanup before killing\n",
    "* Log **worker exits** and watch for crash loops\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Security Hardening\n",
    "\n",
    "* Drop privileges if running as root → use `user` param or container users\n",
    "* Set sensible **request/response limits** (body size, headers)\n",
    "* Disable/limit HTTP headers you don’t need (e.g., `Server`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track **requests/sec, error rate, p95 latency** per worker\n",
    "* Export worker lifecycle metrics (restarts, crashes, timeouts)\n",
    "* Log structured: request\\_id, status, duration, worker\\_id\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "With tuned **workers, timeouts, and keepalive**, your API avoids **slow leaks, socket exhaustion, and worker hangs**, staying **stable and performant at scale**.\n",
