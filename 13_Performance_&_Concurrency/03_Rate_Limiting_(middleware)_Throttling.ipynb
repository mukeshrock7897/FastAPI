    "# 🚧 Rate Limiting (Middleware) & Throttling\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Protect your API and upstream dependencies by **controlling request rates** per client, route, or resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Why Rate Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevent **abuse** & brute force\n",
    "* Protect **DB/external APIs** from overload\n",
    "* Ensure **fair use** across tenants/keys\n",
    "* Stabilize latency during traffic spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Core Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Token Bucket** → steady average with short bursts (most common)\n",
    "* **Leaky Bucket** → smooth, constant drain (good for shaping)\n",
    "* **Fixed Window** → simple, risk of edge bursts\n",
    "* **Sliding Window** → fairer than fixed, slightly heavier\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Keys & Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Who**: API key, user ID, IP, tenant, OAuth client\n",
    "* **What**: route/path, method, resource (e.g., org\\_id)\n",
    "* **Where**: region/edge vs core API\n",
    "* Combine dimensions for granular control (e.g., `tenant + route`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗄️ State & Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In-memory** → single-instance demos; not distributed\n",
    "* **Redis** → production-grade, atomic ops, expirations\n",
    "* **CDN/Edge** → offload at the edge (per-pop limits)\n",
    "* Persist **counters** with TTLs; use Lua scripts for atomic updates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Policies & Tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Default global limit (e.g., **100 req/min**)\n",
    "* Per-route stricter limits (e.g., login, search)\n",
    "* Premium tiers with higher quotas/burst sizes\n",
    "* **Exempt** internal healthchecks, webhooks from trusted partners (carefully)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Responses & Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "* On limit breach: **429 Too Many Requests** with retry guidance\n",
    "* Return standard headers:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `X-RateLimit-Limit`\n",
    "  * `X-RateLimit-Remaining`\n",
    "  * `X-RateLimit-Reset` (epoch seconds)\n",
    "* Keep error bodies **machine-readable** (code, retry\\_after)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Security & Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normalize **IPs** behind proxies (trust only known `X-Forwarded-For`)\n",
    "* Separate **auth’d users** from anonymous IP limits\n",
    "* Block obvious **bot patterns**; slow-path suspicious clients\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Place limiter **before** heavy work (auth/DB) when possible\n",
    "* Use **idempotency keys** to avoid double-charging retries\n",
    "* Bound **burst** size to protect downstream pools\n",
    "* Make policies **config-driven** (per env/tenant)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track **allow/deny counts**, **p95 latency**, **hot routes**, **top keys**\n",
    "* Alert on **deny spikes** and **sustained saturation**\n",
    "* Correlate with **upstream errors** (DB 5xx, external 429)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simulate burst & steady traffic; assert 429 timing\n",
    "* Verify headers and **reset semantics**\n",
    "* Test **distributed** behavior (multiple instances with shared Redis)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A **predictable, resilient** API under load: abusive traffic is **throttled**, legitimate clients get **fair access**, and downstream systems stay **healthy**.\n"
