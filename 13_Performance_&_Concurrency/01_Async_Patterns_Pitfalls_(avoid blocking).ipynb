    "# ⚡ Async Patterns & Pitfalls (Avoid Blocking)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Achieve **high concurrency** without starving the event loop. Keep requests snappy under load.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What Should Be Async\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I/O-bound work**: DB queries, HTTP calls, file/network streams\n",
    "* **Short-lived tasks** inside a single request/response lifecycle\n",
    "* **Reusable clients**: one `AsyncClient` / DB session per request (via DI)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ Common Pitfalls (and fixes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Blocking libraries** (e.g., pure `requests`, heavy crypto/image ops)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Use async libs (httpx, SQLAlchemy async, async drivers) or offload to thread/process (`to_thread`, worker queue).\n",
    "* **CPU-bound work on event loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Move to **background workers** (Celery/RQ/Arq/process pool).\n",
    "* **Unbounded `gather()`** → connection pool exhaustion\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Use **Semaphore/limit concurrency**; batch requests.\n",
    "* **Missing timeouts/retries** → hung tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Always set **timeouts**, **retry with backoff + jitter**.\n",
    "* **Creating clients per call**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ **Reuse** clients (DB/HTTP) via DI; close on teardown.\n",
    "* **Large payloads in memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Stream uploads/downloads; chunk processing.\n",
    "* **Swallowing cancellations**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Propagate `CancelledError`; clean up gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔌 DB & HTTP Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **async drivers** (`asyncpg`, `aiosqlite`) with SQLAlchemy async sessions.\n",
    "* **Pool wisely**: match pool sizes to DB limits; watch timeouts & overflow.\n",
    "* For outbound HTTP: **httpx.AsyncClient** with per-host limits, timeouts, retries.\n",
    "* Prefer **cursor pagination** and **streaming** for large result sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎛️ Concurrency Control\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bounded parallelism**: semaphore limits around fan-out tasks.\n",
    "* **Rate limiting**: per user/key/route to protect resources.\n",
    "* **Backpressure**: queue size limits; drop/defer low-priority work.\n",
    "* **Circuit breaker**: open on repeated failures; fast-fail until healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🕒 Timeouts, Retries, Backoff\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client timeouts**: connect/read/write; never “infinite”.\n",
    "* **Exponential backoff + jitter** to avoid thundering herd.\n",
    "* **Idempotency keys** for safe retries on POST-like actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧹 Resource Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open **once per request**, close on **teardown** (DI + lifespan).\n",
    "* Avoid global singletons with hidden state; prefer explicit injection.\n",
    "* Clean up on **cancellation** (close cursors/streams, rollback transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing Async\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **AsyncClient** and lifespan-aware app factories.\n",
    "* Simulate **timeouts/failures**; assert retries/backoff logic.\n",
    "* Load-test critical endpoints with concurrency; watch 95/99th percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track **event loop lag**, **pool metrics**, **in-flight tasks**, **timeout rates**.\n",
    "* Add **request IDs**; trace DB/HTTP spans with duration & errors.\n",
    "* Alert on **error spikes**, **slow endpoints**, **retry storms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app remains **responsive under load**: async I/O done right, CPU work off the loop, bounded concurrency, and robust timeouts/retries—backed by metrics and traces.\n"
