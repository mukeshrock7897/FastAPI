    "> **Intent** → Enable **real-time, bi-directional communication** between client and server over a persistent connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chat apps** (messages flow instantly)\n",
    "* **Live updates** (dashboards, notifications, stock prices)\n",
    "* **Collaborative apps** (docs, whiteboards)\n",
    "* **Streaming AI/LLM responses** (tokens in real-time)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client upgrades from **HTTP → WebSocket handshake**\n",
    "2. Persistent TCP connection stays open\n",
    "3. Both sides can **send/receive anytime** (full duplex)\n",
    "4. Ends when either side closes the connection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Message Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text frames** → JSON payloads (most common in APIs)\n",
    "* **Binary frames** → images, audio, video chunks\n",
    "* **Ping/Pong** → keepalive & latency measurement\n",
    "* **Close** → graceful shutdown with reason codes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Require **auth on connect** (query param, header, or subprotocol)\n",
    "* Enforce **scopes/permissions** before accepting\n",
    "* **CORS-equivalent** policies for browsers (trusted origins only)\n",
    "* Mitigate **DoS** → timeouts, max connections, payload size limits\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log connects/disconnects with **request ID / user ID**\n",
    "* Track **active connections** and **message throughput**\n",
    "* Emit metrics: latency, dropped connections, error rates\n",
    "* Integrate with tracing for end-to-end visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚖️ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define **clear message schema** (type + payload)\n",
    "* Send **acknowledgements** for critical actions\n",
    "* Implement **heartbeats** to detect dead connections\n",
    "* Backpressure: slow consumers should not crash producers\n",
    "* Plan for **scaling** → use pub/sub (Redis, NATS) across servers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "WebSockets let your API handle **real-time, interactive communication** with clients—powering modern apps like chat, dashboards, and AI streaming.\n",
