    "# 🧾 Structured Logging & Request IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → Produce **machine-parseable logs** with **correlation IDs** so you can trace a request across services, debug fast, and power alerts/dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured** (JSON) logs, not free-text\n",
    "* **Consistent fields** → easy search & aggregation\n",
    "* **Correlation** across services via **Request ID / Trace ID**\n",
    "* **Safe**: no secrets/PII; redaction in place\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Structured Logging (why)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parse into columns: `ts`, `level`, `msg`, `route`, `status`, `latency_ms`, `request_id`, `user_id?`, `service`\n",
    "* Works with ELK, Loki, Cloud Logging, Datadog, Splunk\n",
    "* Enables **metrics from logs** (error rate, p95 latency)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧬 Request / Correlation IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate or accept `X-Request-ID` (or W3C `traceparent`)\n",
    "* **Attach to every log line** within the request lifecycle\n",
    "* Forward downstream in **HTTP headers**; include in responses\n",
    "* On errors, return the **request\\_id** to users for support\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 What to Log (per request)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Start**: method, path, request\\_id, user/tenant (if known)\n",
    "* **Important events**: auth result, DB/HTTP spans, retries, rate-limit decisions\n",
    "* **End**: status, latency, response size, error code (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Errors & Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log **once** at the edge with stack trace + request\\_id\n",
    "* Add **error class**, **message**, **where** (route/handler)\n",
    "* Avoid duplicate logs across middlewares/handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Redaction & Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "* Never log secrets (tokens, passwords, API keys)\n",
    "* Hash or drop **PII**; mask emails/phones if needed\n",
    "* Enforce redaction in a **processor** (central place)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎚️ Levels & Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "* `INFO` for high-level events; `DEBUG` only in dev or sampled\n",
    "* `WARN` for user-correctable; `ERROR` for failed requests\n",
    "* Sample verbose logs on hot routes to control cost/noise\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Propagation & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pass **request\\_id** into dependencies (DB/HTTP clients)\n",
    "* Include **span\\_id/trace\\_id** if using tracing; align field names\n",
    "* Add **service**, **env**, **version** for multi-service clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📤 Destinations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write JSON to **stdout** (12-factor) → ship via sidecar/agent\n",
    "* Keep timestamps in **UTC**; consistent format\n",
    "* Ensure backpressure or buffering won’t block request handling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Ops & Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build views: **errors by route**, **p95 latency**, **top 404s**, **rate-limit hits**\n",
    "* Alert on spikes in `ERROR`, sustained `WARN`, or long latencies\n",
    "* Correlate logs with **metrics** and **traces** for root cause\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "You get **searchable, safe, and correlated** logs: every request carries a **request\\_id**, incidents are traceable, and dashboards/alerts become **trustworthy and actionable**.\n",
    "\n",
