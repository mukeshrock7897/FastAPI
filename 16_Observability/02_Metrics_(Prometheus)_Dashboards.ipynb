    "## 🎯 What to Measure (RED + USE)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Requests**: rate, errors, duration (p50/p90/p95/p99)\n",
    "* **Resources**: CPU, memory, file descriptors, GC, event loop lag\n",
    "* **DB/HTTP**: query counts, pool usage, timeouts/retries, upstream status codes\n",
    "* **Queues/Jobs**: enqueued/running/failed, retry counts, age\n",
    "* **Custom**: business KPIs (signups, orders, cache hit rate)\n",

    "## 🧭 Metric Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Counter** → ever-increasing (requests\\_total, errors\\_total)\n",
    "* **Gauge** → current value (in\\_flight\\_requests, pool\\_size)\n",
    "* **Histogram** → distributions (request\\_duration\\_seconds)\n",
    "* **Summary** → client-side quantiles (use sparingly; prefer histograms)\n",

    "## 🌐 Prometheus Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expose `/metrics` endpoint (text format).\n",
    "* Label consistently: `service`, `env`, `route`, `method`, `status`, `version`, `tenant?`.\n",
    "* Avoid **high-cardinality** labels (user\\_id, request\\_id).\n",
    "* Set **scrape intervals** (e.g., 15s) and **retention** per environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Dashboards (Grafana)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Service overview**: RPS, error rate, p95/p99 latency, saturation (CPU/mem), top 5 slow routes.\n",
    "* **Dependency health**: DB pool saturation, query latency, external API error/timeout rates.\n",
    "* **SLO board**: availability %, latency SLO burn rate, error budgets.\n",
    "* **Release watch**: metrics by `version` label during/after deploys.\n",

    "  * Error budget exhaustion (5xx, 429, timeouts)\n",
    "  * Latency SLO breach (p95 route latency)\n",

    "* Keep label sets **small and bounded**.\n",
