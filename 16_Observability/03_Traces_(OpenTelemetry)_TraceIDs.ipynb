    "# 🕸️ Traces (OpenTelemetry) & Trace IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Intent** → See a single request’s **journey** across services (API → DB → HTTP calls → queue) with **end-to-end timing and context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What Tracing Gives You\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Causality & timing** across hops (who called what, how long).\n",
    "* **Bottleneck detection** (slow DB query, external API, serialization).\n",
    "* **Error localization** (which span failed, with attributes).\n",
    "* **Correlation** with logs/metrics via **trace\\_id**/**span\\_id**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trace**: a tree of **spans** representing one request flow.\n",
    "* **Span**: timed operation with attributes (route, DB table, status).\n",
    "* **Context propagation**: pass **traceparent** headers across services.\n",
    "* **Resources**: service-level attributes (name, version, env, region).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What to Instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inbound requests** (FastAPI middleware) → root span: route + status\n",
    "* **DB calls** (SQLAlchemy, drivers) → query duration, rows, pool waits\n",
    "* **HTTP clients** (httpx) → URL template, method, status, retries\n",
    "* **Queues/jobs** (Celery/RQ/Arq) → link enqueue span ↔ worker span\n",
    "* **Custom spans** for business steps (validation, pricing, rendering)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Attributes That Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "* `http.route`, `http.method`, `http.status_code`\n",
    "* `db.system`, `db.statement?` (redact PII), `db.sql.table`\n",
    "* `peer.service`, `net.peer.name`, `retry.count`\n",
    "* `user.id?`, `tenant.id?` (hashed/anonymized if needed)\n",
    "* Always **redact secrets/PII** at the source\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Sampling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Head sampling** (at request start): keep X% of traces globally.\n",
    "* **Tail sampling** (collector): keep **slow/errors** at higher rate.\n",
    "* **Dynamic** during incidents or for hot routes; tag by `env=prod`.\n",
    "* Keep storage costs sane while preserving **useful** traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Correlating with Logs & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inject **trace\\_id / span\\_id** into log records (structured logging).\n",
    "* Add **exemplars** to latency histograms for quick trace jump.\n",
    "* From a 5xx spike → jump to sample traces → root cause fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧯 Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mark spans with **status=ERROR** and **exception** events.\n",
    "* Record **type**, **message**, **stack** (sanitized).\n",
    "* Avoid double-reporting: log once at the edge, annotate in spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Visualizations (Backends)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **OTel Collector** → export to Jaeger/Tempo/Zipkin/New Relic/Datadog.\n",
    "* Dashboards: **waterfall views**, **service maps**, **top slow routes**.\n",
    "* Compare traces **before/after** deploys or feature flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Operational Hygiene\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardize **service.name**, **deployment.environment**, **version**.\n",
    "* Keep attribute **cardinality** bounded; don’t tag with raw IDs everywhere.\n",
    "* Ensure **propagation** through gateways/proxies; don’t strip headers.\n",
    "* Budget telemetry cost: sample, drop noisy spans, compress exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "You gain **end-to-end visibility**: a request’s full path with **timings, errors, and context**, linked to logs and metrics—so you can **diagnose performance issues** and **fix incidents** rapidly.\n"
